      "This is part 2 of the workshop -- getting started with Matplotlib presented by Gina Schmalzle.\n",
      "In this part of the workshop we will learn how to make:\n",
      "1. Scatter Plots -- we will also learn how to change the attributes of the scatterplot.\n",
      "2. Histograms -- we will play around with how these look too.\n",
      "3. Maps!  We will also learn how to put data on maps too.\n",

      "# The Data \n",
      "I thought it would be fun to work with real data instead of some randomly generated data.  The data we will use are modeled weather forecasts at weather stations across the United States.  This information is presented on the [OpenWeatherMap project](http://openweathermap.org/) who provides an API service to download this information, but unfortunately, does not keep a historical record of the forecasts.  Gina and her friend David Branner created a [database](https://github.com/WeatherStudy/weather_study) that collects the weather forecasts for these stations.  The file target_day_20140422.dat that came in this repo was extracted from this database collecting the forecasts.  It is a flat file of weather forecasts for each station in the United States for the 'target day' of April 22, 2014. The stations themselves are defined by their latitude and longitude and the file contains forecasts that were done 0 to 7 days out, where day zero is the forecast made on April 22.  Hence a forecast made one day out was made on April 21, two days out April 20th, etc. \n",

      "# Getting to the Basics -- Data Structures\n",
      "A basic understanding of data structures is useful when playing with an visualizing data, so we will go over some data structures that will be used in this notebook.  In computer science, a data structure is a way to organize data in a computer that makes it computationally efficient.  Here we will be using two basic data structures:  *lists* and *dictionaries*.  \n",
